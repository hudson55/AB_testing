# Introduction
(refer to side 3)
It's a general methodology used online when you want to test new product or feature. You'll take 2 sets of users, one set control set which means existing product/feature and another set will be your experiment meaning new version. We will see how these users responded differently in order to determine which version of feature is better
Examples:some new feature, different look for your website, additions to UI
drawbacks: when deciding which camera review to show first, ab testing can show which one but it cannot show if tere is an entire different camer review that weare not even looking at
